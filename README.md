## .env Files

Your first job will be add files in order to successfully connect to the two databases locally

- create an env.test file in the root directory of the project
- create an env.development file in the root directory of the project
- add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here> and replace the values for each environment variable with the corresponding values for your local set up
- save your changes

With these environment variables set up, you should be able to run the project locally and connect to the two databases.

>**Hint**: Make sure to add this files to your "gitignore" file as this ensures that sensitive information like passwords and host URLs are not accidentally exposed.
